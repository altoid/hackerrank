first figure out how many digits are different in each half of the number.  if that number is greater than k,
game over.

get pairwise differences

if k is smaller than the number of pairs, we can't meet the constraint ==> -1

if k is equal to the number of pairs,
then we change one digit in each pair to be the largest of the digits in the pair

if k is greater than the number of pairs but less than the # of pairs * 2,
change outermost pairs to 9s if they are not already 9s

if the number of digits is odd and we can change the middle digit, make it a 9

if we've changed all the pairwise mismatches to 9s, and we can still make more changes,
change MATCHING pairs to 9s.

if we can change the middle digit, change it last.
