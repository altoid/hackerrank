gives insight on how to generate magic squares for nxn where n is odd.
apparently for any (odd) value of n, the magic number is a function of n.

for n = 3, there is one magic square, discounting reflection and rotation.
for n = 5, there are 275,305,224.  i'm guessing that the problem only cares
about n = 3.
